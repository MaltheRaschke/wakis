# ðŸ“š User's Guide

This section aims to showcase `wakis`capabilities together with useful recipes to use in the simulation scripts.

Since `wakis` has been developed for computing bea, coupling impedance for particle accelerator components, the example that will serve as a conductive thread for the explanation is a **pillbox cavity with a passing proton beam**. 

The guide will go into detailed step-by-step on how to write the simulation script and visualize or access the computed data.

## Import modules

The first part of a python script always includes importing external sources of code e.g., `packages` or `modules`. In `wakis`, we use:

* `numpy`: Used for numerical operations, especially for matrix operations.
* `scipy.constants`: to import physical constants easily like vacuum permittivity `eps_0` or the speed of light `c`
* `matplotlib`: Used for 1d and 2d plotting and visualization.
* `h5py`: To store data in the memory-efficient format HDF5
* `tqdm`: This package is used for displaying progress bars in loops.
* `pyvista`: For handling and visualizing 3D CAD geometries and vtk-based 3D plotting.

Optionally, one can use `os` or `sys` packages to handle the PATH and directory creations. The first part of any simulaiton script could look similar to:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import os, sys
import pyvista as pv
import h5py
from tqdm import tqdm
from scipy.constants import c as c_light
```

Next step is to import the `wakis` classes that will allow to run the electromagnetic simulations:

```python
from gridFIT3D import GridFIT3D        # Grid generation
from solverFIT3D import SolverFIT3D    # EM field simulation
from wakeSolver import WakeSolver      # Wake and Impedance calculation
```

## Simulation domain, geometry and materials setup

`wakis` is a numerical electromagnetic solver that uses the Finite Integration Technique. The grid used is a structured grid composed by rectangular cells. The simulation domain is a rectangular box that will be broken into cells where the electromagnetic fields will be computed.

### Number of mesh cells

 In every `wakis` simulation example, the script starts specifying the number of mesh cells per direction the user wants to use:

```python
# ---------- Domain setup ---------
# Number of mesh cells
Nx = 50
Ny = 50
Nz = 100
```

```{note}
Note that the number of cells will heavily affect the simulation time (in particular, the timestep due to CFL condition), and also the memory requirements.
```
 
### `STL` geometry importing
In beam-coupling impedance simulations one is usually interested in the geometric impedance, together with the impedance coming from material properties. In `wakis`, the geometry to simulate (sometimes referred as Embedded boundaries) can be imported from a `.stl` file containing a CAD model.

```python
# stl geometry files (add path to them if necessary)
stl_cavity = 'cavity.stl' 
stl_shell = 'shell.stl'
stl_solids = {'cavity': stl_cavity, 'shell': stl_shell}

# Optional: plot the geometry imported using PyVista
geometry = pv.read(stl_shell) + pv.read(stl_cavity)
geometry.plot() # add pyvista **kwargs to make a fancier plot
```
![geometry plot example using a few pyvista **kwargs](img/geometry_plot.png)

```{seealso}
Check [PyVista's documentation](https://docs.pyvista.org/version/stable/user-guide/simple.html#plotting) for more advanced 3d plotting
```

Imported `.stl` files can also be translated, rotated and scaled in x, y, z by providing a list. E.g., `stl_scale['cavity'] = [1., 2, 1.]` will duplicate the y dimension of the imported cavity.stl.

```python
stl_scale = {'cavity': [1., 1., 2.], 'shell': [1., 1., 2.]} # scale factor
stl_rotate = {'cavity': [1., 1., 90.], 'shell': [1., 1., 90.]}  # rotate angle (degrees)
stl_translate = {'cavity': [1., 0, 0], 'shell': [1., 0, 0]} # displacement in [m]
```

### Associating a material to each solid
Each `stl` solid can be associated with a material by indicating `[eps, mu, conductivity]`. In `materials.py`, the most used materials are available in the material library. The user can specify a value for the relative permittivity $\varepsilon$, the relative permeability $\mu$ and the value for the conductivity $\sigma$ in [S/m] or use the material name from the library:

```python
# Indicate relative permittivity, relative permeability and conductivity [S/m]
# [eps_r, mu_r, conductivity] 
# or the material name from the library:
stl_materials = {'cavity': 'vacuum',       # equivalent to [1.0, 1.0, 0]
                'shell': [1e3, 1.0, 1e3]}  # equivalent to a 'lossy metal'
```

### Defining the `grid` object
After this, the user needs to indicate the domain bounds to simulate. They can be calculated from the imported geometry or just hardcoded:

``` python
# Domain bounds
geometry = pv.read(stl_shell) + pv.read(stl_cavity)
xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, zmin, zmax = geometry.bounds
```

Finally, we can build our simulation grid using `GridFIT3D` class including all the information above:

```python
# initialize grid object
grid = GridFIT3D(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, zmin, zmax, 
                Nx, Ny, Nz, 
                stl_solids=stl_solids, 
                stl_materials=stl_materials,
                stl_translate=stl_translate,
                stl_scale=stl_scale
                stl_rotate=stl_rotate
                )
```

Optionally, the `grid` of the simulation can be inspected interactively in 3D (thanks to PyVista):

```python
grid.inspect(add_stl=['cavity', 'shell'] #default is all stl solids
             stl_opacity=0.5             #default is 0.5
             stl_colors=['blue', 'red']) #default is `white`
```

 ![Gif showing how the grid.inspect() method works](img/grid_inspect.gif)

`wakis` API is fully exposed, so all the `grid` class parameters relevant for the simulation can be accessed as class attributes and modified once the class has been instantiated. E.g., `grid.dx` gives the mesh step size in x direction, `grid.N` gives the total number of cells. Attributes can be checked by typing `grid.` and then pressing `TAB` when running on `ipython`.

```{tip}
Thanks to a fully exposed python API, all (relevant) class attributes can be checked by typing the class instance (e.g., `grid` or `solver`) followed a dot `.` and the name of the attribute. 

When running on `ipython` all attributes and functions() can be viewed by typing the name of the class instance + `.` and then pressing `TAB`. Similarly, when writing code on a IDE (e.g., Visual Studio), a list with all the attributes and functions will be shown when typing e.g., `solver.`. 
```

## Setting up the electromagnetic solver

Once the simulation domain has been defined through the geometry and the grid, the electromagnetic (EM) solver can be created. The solver implemented in `wakis` uses the Finite Integration Technique (FIT) [^1]. The recipe on how to instantiate the `SolverFIT3D` class is given below:

```python
solver = SolverFIT3D(grid=grid,     # pass grid object
                     dt=dt,         # (OPTIONAL) define timestep
                     cfl=0.5,       # Default if no dt is defined
                     bc_low=bc_low, 
                     bc_high=bc_high, 
                     use_stl=True,     # Enables or disables geometry import
                     bg='vacuum',      # Background material 
                     )

```

### Simulation timestep
The simulation timestep is calculated following the CFL condition, that mainly depends on the cell size. A default value of 0.5 ensures simulation stability:
```python
# Extract of SolverFIT3D __init__
self.dt = cfln / (c_light * np.sqrt(1 / self.grid.dx ** 2 + 1 / self.grid.dy ** 2 +
                                            1 / self.grid.dz ** 2))
```

### Boundary conditions
The required parameters `bc_low` and `bc_high` allow to choose the 6 boundary conditions for our simulation box. For the lower-end boundaries bc_low = [x-, y-, z-] and for the high-end boundaries bc_high = [x+, y+, z+] is used. The supported values to give for -/+ boundaries are:

* `pec` stands for Perfect Electric Conductor: it is a Dirichlet boundary conditions that forces the tangent electric $E$ field at the boundary to be 0. 
* `pmc` stands for Perfect Magnetic Conductor: similarly to pec, it is a Dirichlet boundary conditions that forces the tangent magnetic $H$ field at the boundary to be 0.
* `periodic`: The field values of the high-end boundary are passed to the lower-end boundary, simulating a periodic structure where the fields re-enter the simulation domain.
* `abc` First order extrapolation (FOEXTRAP) absorbing boundary condition (ABC)[^2]: a type of Dirichlet absorbing boundary condition that allows to absorb longitudinally propagating fields when they reach the boundary. Only works under specific circumstances.
* `pml` Perfect Matching Layer: A more advanced type of ABC, capable of absorbing electromagnetic waves propagating in a wider range of propagation angles [^3]. This boundary conditions are needed e.g., for simulating accelerator beampipe transitions and RF cavities above beampipe cutoff. *Currently under development*

An example of the boundary conditions that are typically used for the pillbox cavity example are:

```python
# boundary conditions
bc_low=['pec', 'pec', 'pml']  #or z=`pec` if below cutoff
bc_high=['pec', 'pec', 'pml'] #or z=`pec` if below cutoff
```
### Accessing `solver`'s fields, matrices and simulation parameters
Similarly to the `grid` object from `GridFIT3D`, `wakis`'s `SolverFIT3D` class is fully exposed. This means that once the `solver` object is instantiated, all the parameters of the EM solver can be accessed as class attributes `solver.attr` and modified. E.g., one can modify the simulation timestep after the instantiation by doing:

```python
solver.dt = 1e-9 #[s]
```

#### Electromagnetic fields `E`, `J`, `H`
Once the solver has been instantiated, the electromagnetic fields electric $E$, magnetic $H$ and current $J$ can be accessed and modified to e.g., add initial conditions to the simulation. The fields are 3D vectorial matrices of sizes [Nx, Ny, Nz]x3. The times 3 comes from their vectorial nature, since there are values for each simulation cell in $x$, $y$, and $z$ direction. Below an example on how to access the electric field component $E_z$ to add an initial condition to the field:

```python
# modify the lower left bottom corner (cell [0,0,0]) of the simulation domain.
solver.E[0,0,0,'z'] = c_light 

# modify the x component of H for a XY plane at a particular z 
iz = Nz//3
solver.H[:, :, iz, 'x'] = np.ones((Nx, Ny))

# modify the y component of the J on the z axis at a particular x, y
ix, iy = Nx//2, Ny//2
solver.J[ix, iy, :,'y']

# get the absolute value of the electric field
E_abs = solver.E.get_abs() #size [Nx, Ny, Nz]
```

The routines `inspect()` for 2D and `inspect3d()` allow for quick visualization of the field values:
``` python
solver.E.inspect(plane='YZ',            # 2d plane, cut at the domain center
                 cmap='bwr',            # colormap
                 dpi=100,               # plot DPI value (pixel resolution)
                 # also, the plane can be specified as a 2D slice in x,y,z
                 # e.g., for the YZ plane at x = Nx//2
                 x=Nx//2, 
                 y=slice(0,Ny), 
                 z=slice(0,Nz) 
                )

```

#### Material tensors `ieps`, `imu`, `sigma`

The same applies for the material tensors for permittivity $\varepsilon$, permeability $\mu$, and conductivity $\sigma$. For computational cost reasons, the values saved in memory correspond to $\varepsilon^{-1}$ and $\mu^{-1}$.  To access a specific value or a slice of values (and modify them if desired):

```python
# permittivity(^-1) tensor in x direction
solver.ieps[:, :, :, 'x']

# permeability(^-1) tensor in y direction
solver.imu[:, :, :, 'y']

# Modify first 10 cells in x of the conductivity tensor:
for d in ['x', 'y', 'z']:
    solver.sigma[:10, :, :, d] = np.ones(10)*1e3 #S/m 
```

Since `wakis` supports anisotropy, the tensors are 3D matrices of sizes `[Nx, Ny, Nz]x3` since there are values for each simulation cell in $x$, $y$, and $z$ direction. Similarly, one can inspect the values given to the tensors by using e.g., `solver.sigma.inspect()`


```{tip}
Material tensors $\varepsilon$, $\mu$, and $\sigma$, and electromagnetic fields $E$, $H$ and $J$ are created as `Field` objects, the class in `field.py`. This class allows for optimized access to matrix values, conversion to array format using the lexico-grapihc index and inspection methods Ã¬nspect()` via 2D plots to confirm that the tensor are built correctly before running the simulation.
```
### Running a simulation

{#running-a-simulation}
Once the domain and geometry are defined in `grid` and the fields and internal operators have been instantiated with `solver`, an electromagnetic time-domain simulation can be run provided some initial conditions. The simplest way to run the code, step-by-step, is by calling the routine `solver.one_setp()`:
```python
# Run one step (advance from t=0 to t=dt)
solver.one_step()

# Run a number of timesteps while modifying the fields
hf = h5py.File('results/Ex.h5', 'w')
Nt = 100
for n in tqdm(range(Nt)):

    # [OPTIONAL] Modify field
    #source_fun(t) can be any function, see next section
    solver.E[:, :, :, 'x'] = source_fun(n*dt) 

    # Advance
    solver.one_step()

    # [OPTIONAL] Plot 2D on-the-fly. -->See dedicated section.
    solver.plot2D(field='E', component='x', plane='ZY', pos=0.5, # 
                  cmap='rainbow', title='img/Ex', off_screen=True,  
                  n=n, interpolation='spline36')
    
    # [OPTIONAL] Save in hdf5 format 
    hf['#'+str(n).zfill(5)]=solver.E[Nx//2, :, :, 'x'] 
```

A more optimized solution for running a EM simulation is the routine `solver.emsolve()`. This removes the need of the loop, while still allows to use built-in plotting routines and saving the fields at any timestep though the input arguments:

```python
# emsolve function call example
Nt = 10000              # Number of timesteps to run
source = sources.Beam() # [OPTIONAL] ->See next section for details

solver.emsolve(Nt, source=source, # [OPT] field or current time-dependent source 
            save=False, fields=['E'], components=['Abs'], # [OPT] field components to save
            every=1, subdomain=None, # [OPT] frequency of save and subdomain slice [x,y,z]
            plot=False, plot_every=1,  # [OPT] on-the-fly plot enable and frequency
            plot3d=False, # [OPT] use 3D plot instead of 2D
            **kwargs) # [OPT] plot arguments. ->See built-in plotting section for details

```

```{tip}
All the functions inside `wakis` are documented with `docstrings` explaining each input parameter. To access it (after instantiating the class) simply type a question mark at the end, e.g.:
`solver.emsolve?` or `solver.plot3D?`
```

## Adding time-dependent sources

In most time-domain simulations, when the field is not excited by initial conditions, a time-dependent source is used that to update the field values at a particular region in the simulation domain. In `wakis`, several time-dependent sources are available inside `sources.py`. They can be passed to the `solver` object in order for them to be added to the time-stepping routine.

Sources in `wakis` can be: 
* Point sources: only modifying the field or field component at one specific location $(x_s, y_s, z_s)$
* Line sources: modifying the field over a line $(x_s, y_s, \forall z)$
* Plane or port sources: modifying the field on a 2d plane e.g., $z=z_s \forall x,y$
* Volume sources: modify the field in a 3d subdomain: e.g., $z=slice(0, Nz-30) \forall x,y$. 

The sources can modify any component of the $E$, $H$ fields or the current $J$.

To add a time-dependent source, one can simply setup a time-loop and run the routine `solver.one_step()` after the source has been applied (see [Running a simulation](#running-a-simulation) section). However, a more optimized way is to pass a `source` to the EM solver. The `source` objects available inside `sources.py` are:
* `Beam`: a line source for $J_z$ that adds a gaussian-shaped current traversing the domain from z- to z+. Beam's longitudinal size $sigma_z$ and peak current $q$, as well as transverse position, can be defined as class attributes during instantiation. 
* `PlaneWave`: a port source that excites a sinusoidal plane wave n +z direction by modifying $E_x$ and $H_y$ in the XY plane. Plane wave's frequency $f$, longitudinal position $z_s$, and plane extent $(\bold{x_s}, \bold{y_s})$ an be defined as class attributes. 
* `WavePacket`: a port source that excites a gaussian wave packet that travels in z+ direction, by modifying $H_y$ and $E_x$ field components. The frequency $f$ or wavelength $\lambda$, longitudinal size $sigma_z$, transverse size $sigma_{xy}$ and propagation speed (relativistic $\beta$), can be defined as class attributes. 

The user can easily add a `CustomSource` by following this pseudocode recipe:
```python
class CustomSource:
    def __init__(self, attr1, attr2):
        '''
        Docstring
        '''

        # Class initialization of attributes

        self.attr1 = attr1
        self.attr2 = attr2


    def update(self, solver, t):
        # solver will be a `SolverFIT3D` class object
        # Here goes the code that should be run every timestep

        # e.g., point source at the 10th cell of the domain in x,y,z on Ex
        solver.E[10,10,10,'x'] = self.attr1*t

        # e.g., line source for all z at domain center in xy, on Jz
        solver.J[solver.Nx//2,solver.Ny//2,:,'z'] = self.attr1*solver.z*t

        # e.g., port source on XY plane at first cell 0 in z, on Hy
        X, Y = np.meshgrid(solver.x, solver.y)
        solver.H[:,:,0,'y'] = np.exp(-(X**2+Y**2)/self.attr1)*t
```

Combining `wakis` sources, geometry capabilities and material tensors, many different physical phenomena can be simulated with `wakis`: laser pulses, interaction with plasma, waveguides... For particle accelerators, the `Beam` class was created but the profile and trajectory can be easily modified to simulate advanced impedance effects.


## Using `wakis` as an electromagnetic Wakefield solver

### A few words about beam-coupling impedance

The determination of electromagnetic wakefields and their impact on accelerator performance is a significant issue in current accelerator components. These wakefields, which are generated within the accelerator vacuum chamber as a result of the interaction between the structure and a passing beam, can have significant effects on the machine. 

These effects can be characterized through the beam coupling impedance in the frequency domain, and wake potential in the time domain. Accurate evaluation of these properties is essential for predicting dissipated power and maintaining beam stability. `wakis` project was conceived at CERN, in the ABP-CEI group, to provide the accelerator community with a python based, open-source tool able to compute the beam-coupling impedance for present and future accelerator components.


### Setting up the wake solver

`wakis` can compute wake potential and impedance for both longitudinal and transverse planes for general 3D structures. The wake computation is performed right after the electromagnetic simulation, and the dedicated routines are encapsulated in the class `WakeSolver`, inside `wakeSolver.py`. The recipe on how to instantiate the `WakeSolver`class is:

```python
wake = WakeSolver(q=q, # beam charge in Coulombs [C]
                 sigmaz=sigmaz, # beam longitudinal sigma in [m]
                 beta=beta,     # beam relativistic beta
                 xsource=xs, ysource=ys, # beam transverse source position (DIPOLAR)
                 xtest=xt, ytest=yt,     # beam transverse integration path (QUADRUPOLAR)
                 add_space=add_space,    # remove no. cells in z- and z+ from the wake integration
                 save=True, logfile=True # save results in txt format and enable logfile
                 results_folder='results/',   # Name of the results folder 
                 Ez_file='Ez.h5',        # Name of the HDF5 file to store E field 
                 )
```

As can be deduced from the instantiation, the `wake` object contains the information of the beam source. When `wake` is passed to the `solver` object, a `Beam` source will be automatically added using `wake` attributes.

```{tip}
The attribute `add_space` is a very useful addition to improve the wake potential calculation. it removes the specified no. of cells from the integration path e.g., `add_space=10` removes the last 10 cells in z- and in z+. This allows to remove some perturbations caused by the beam injection or some unwanted reflections from the domain boundaries.
```

### Running a wakefield simulation
A wakefield simulation can be run using the `solver.wakesolve` routine. Similarly to `emsolve` it will run the electromagnetic simulation until a desired `wakelength` is reached. Then, the wake potential and impedance in longitudinal and transverse planes will be computed from the field saved in `Ez.h5` file:

```python
solver.wakesolve(wakelength, # Simulation wakelength in [m]
                wake=wake,   # wake object of WakeSolver class
                add_space=add_space,  
                save_J=True,   # [OPT] Save source current Jz in HDF5 format
                plot=False, plot_every=30, # [OPT] Enable 2Dplot and plot frequency
                **plotkw, # [OPT] plot arguments. ->See built-in plotting section for details 
                )
```
### Recomputing some magnitudes
Once the simulation is finished and the data is safely stored in the HDF5 file, any result of wake potential and/or impedance can be re-computed and optimized. For instance, the longitudinal or transverse impedance can be recomputed using a higher number of samples or a different maximum frequency:

```python
# re-calculate longitudinal impedance from the wake.WP result
wake.calc_long_Z(samples=10001, fmax=2e9)
plt.plot(wake.f, np.real(wake.Z)) #plot real part
plt.plot(wake.f, np.imag(wake.Z)) #plot imaginary part
plt.plot(wake.f, np.abs(wake.Z))  #plot absolute

# re-calculate transverse impedance from the wake.WPx and WPy result
wake.calc_trans_Z(samples=10001, fmax=2e9)
plt.plot(wake.f, np.abs(wake.Zx)) #plot absolute of Zx
plt.plot(wake.f, np.abs(wake.Zy)) #plot absolute of Zy
```
